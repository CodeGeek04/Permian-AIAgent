00:00:46:05 I noticed a few words got cut off taking away from the flow. Updated at the end and thought instead of thoughts at the beginning,Overlapping elements on screen
"00:00:22:08 It is hard to tell what the video is for. Could we have a cool overlay that shows ""LEVELS Continuous Glucose Monitor"" at the beginning of the clip?  At 0:26 Can the screenshot be of the Levels app instead of FreeStyle? At the end, instead of talking about data sharing, can we replace with a quick montage of usefull Levels features and sell the product?",Overlapping elements on screen

"00:01:00:20 I don't watch a lot of short form, so new to this. But wondering if there is a way to have a cleaner end to the videos. Maybe my logo pushing in really quick instead of a hard end to the video segment that was cut. Please let me know your thoughts.",
00:00:18:09 I've uploaded again with the correction you can check it!,
00:00:22:08 i can replace the screenshots but promoting levels at the end might be repetitive as i've already created a reel for the same,Captions repeating at different timestamps
